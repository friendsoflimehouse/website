            We aim to develop and implement an evidence-based, strategic approach to tackle pollution in Limehouse. Simply planting trees is not a sufficient solution, as planting them on the wrong side of the road can increase pollution. Improving air quality is a complex process that requires expertise. To this end, we have reached out to ARUP, a team of global air pollution experts, who are willing to conduct research in the area and provide recommendations for a master plan. While this plan would cost Â£50K, it is necessary for the improvement of air quality in the area. We believe that the residents of Limehouse deserve a safe and healthy environment, and we want to empower them by returning agency to the community. We recognize that Tower Hamlets Council has a budget for tackling pollution, but they are not taking sufficient action. Therefore, we need to work together to implement an evidence-based strategy for tackling pollution in Limehouse.
